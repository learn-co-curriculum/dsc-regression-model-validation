For example, if you were looking at sales data for a website, you might expect the data to look different on days that promotional deals were held versus days that deals were not held. If we don't randomly split the data, there is a chance we might overfit to the characteristics of certain segments of data.\n", "\n", "Another thing to consider is just how big each training and testing set should be. There is no hard and fast rule for deciding the correct size, but the range of training set is usually anywhere from 66% - 80% (and testing set between 33% and 20%). Some types of machine learning models need a substantial amount of data to train on, and as such, the training sets should be larger. Some models with many different tuning parameters will need to be validated with larger sets (the test size should be larger) to determine what the optimal parameters should be.
